# TIC-TAC-TOE-Game

This is an A.I based Game.

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper.
The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. 
The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces.
Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonalway.
Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.


Steps to Build a Python Tic Tac Toe Game:

- Create the display window for our game.
- Draw the grid on the canvas where we will play Tic Tac Toe.
- Draw the status bar below the canvas to show which player’s turn is it and who wins the game.
- When someone wins the game or the game is a draw then we reset the game.


# Min-Max Algorithm:

Mini-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. 
It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally.
Mini-Max algorithm uses recursion to search through the game-tree.
Min-Max algorithm is mostly used for game playing in AI. Such as Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, go, and various tow-players game. 
This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state.
